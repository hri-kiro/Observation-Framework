# Observation Framework

## Project Overview
This repository contains the executable codes for our recent paper on the observation study framework. The project focuses on data analysis and visualization using various datasets and aims to identify hidden states through advanced statistical methods.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Rdata/` : Contains R dataset files

## Running the Code
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Place the `calculate_reliability.R`, `compare_age_difference.R`, and `compare_gender_difference.R` files are in the same directory as `Rdata/` directory.
   
2. **Running the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open `Code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the notebook step-by-step to process the data, identify hidden states, and perform data analysis and visualization.

3. **Excel Integration**:
   - The code utilizes Excel for certain parts of the data processing. Ensure Excel is installed and integrated correctly for seamless execution.

## Analysis and Visualization
- The notebook will analyze the data to identify hidden states using statistical methods.
- It provides detailed visualizations to interpret the identified hidden states and insights from the data.
